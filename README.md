# PCI-PCIX-PCIE
PCI Info:
PCI – Peripheral Component Interface
Developed in 1990s to support the shortcoming of peripheral buses
Buses before PCI are:
    IBM AT(Advanced Technology) referred to other vendors as ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) bus sufficient for 286 16-bit architecture
    32-bit machines need additional bandwidth and improved capabilities like plug-and-play.
To afford it ISA used big connecters which leads to more pin count
Alternatively, PC vendors proposed alternate ideas such as:
    IBM’s MCA(Micro Channel Architecture) the EISA(Extended ISA) proposed as an open standard by IBM Competitors.
    VESA bus (Video Electronic Standards Association) proposed by video card vendors
        Because of their drawbacks these prevented wide acceptance.
PCI is introduced as an open standard by a consortium PCISIG (PCI Special Interest Group)
Ease and flexible usage it becomes the standard bus quickly.
Logical extension of PCI architecture is PCI-X (PCI eXtended)
Later PCI-X 2.0 is added wit higher speeds achieving data rate of 4GB/s.
PCI-X maintained hardware backward compatibility with PCI, it remains parallel bus and inherited the problems
Speed ceiling, high pin count, motivated the transition away from the parallel bus to the new serial bus model.
